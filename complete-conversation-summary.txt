## Cost Structure & Mitigation

### Major Cost Centers

1. **Flight Data APIs** (Most Expensive)
   - FlightAware: $200-2000+/month
   - AviationStack: $50-500/month
   - OpenSky Network: FREE (community-driven)
   - **Strategy:** Start with free/cheaper APIs, cache aggressively

2. **Infrastructure**
   - WebSocket servers for real-time updates

## Final Thoughts

The key differentiator is making this app **proactive rather than reactive**. Most existing apps simply display flight information. Your app should:

1. **Anticipate problems** before users realize them
2. **Take automated action** to solve issues
3. **Learn user preferences** to personalize experience
4. **Create habits** through daily engagement
5. **Build community** through social features
6. **Provide tangible value** that's easy to quantify

The addiction mechanics aren't manipulative - they genuinely make travel less stressful while creating a product users love and depend on.

**Start lean, validate early, scale gradually.** Perfect is the enemy of done. Ship the MVP, get feedback, iterate quickly.

The most important metric is whether users find it valuable enough to pay for. Focus on solving real problems, and the retention will follow.
